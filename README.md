Automated testing
===
---
This project is the author's first approach to software test automation. It was created as part of the *Tester AutomatyzujÄ…cy* course, during which the author, through independent work with the code, explored the essence of both manual and automatic testing. Progress on learning how to write automated tests has been posted in this repository. Technologies listed at the bottom of the conspectus were used to work on several types of tests, such as unit, integration, and acceptance tests.


### Basics

---
Java is the programming language that the author chose to create his tests. For this, he learned its basics. Java is used in all modules of this project.

### Unit testing

---
Unit tests were used to verify the correct operation of the code. Unit testing was done using the JUnit library. It was used to organize tests while learning how to write them. The author, being aware of the importance of following the Don't Repeat Yourself principle, tried to share some code fragments by writing parameterized tests. Delving into the subject of unit testing, the author also used the possibilities offered by the Mockito library. She also tried to use Spring libraries, testing isolated classes from the project.


### Integration testing

---

The author also undertook to write automated integration tests. The Selenium library was used to test the simulation of user behavior in the web application. Selenium enabled automated interaction with the GUI.


### Acceptance testing

---

Acceptance tests are used to check whether the application behaves correctly. These tests should be understandable to every team member who works on this application. The team consists of people from various industries. For the purposes of effective communication between them, the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach was created to simplify the language of communication. The tool used in this project, used both for test automation and for communication between people with different competencies, was Cucumber.
